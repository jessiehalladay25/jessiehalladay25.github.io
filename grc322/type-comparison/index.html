        <h1>Univers vs. Acumin </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3 class="univers">Univers</h3>
			 
             <p>This typeface is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family designed by Swiss type designer Adrian Frutiger in collaboration with Linotype Design Studios. Frutiger began sketching the typeface in Zurich in the early 1950s and completed its development in France, where it was released in 1957 by the Paris foundry Deberny & Peignot. The typeface was created during the rise of photocomposition technology, which was beginning to replace traditional metal type, and Univers was specifically designed to take advantage of this new production method. Historically, it was influenced by nineteenth-century German grotesque sans-serifs but refined to match the clarity and rationality valued in the Swiss Modernist design movement. One of Univers’s most important innovations was its systematic family structure, introduced through Frutiger’s two-digit numbering system that categorized weight, width, and style, allowing designers to easily navigate a large, unified type family. Its versatility and modern aesthetic led to rapid licensing by companies such as Linotype, Monotype, American Type Founders, and IBM, helping make it one of the most widely used typefaces of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
             
			 <h3 class="acumin">Acumin</h3>

             <p>This typeface is a contemporary neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family designed by American type designer Robert Slimbach and released by Adobe in 2015 as part of the Adobe Originals library. The typeface was developed during a period when typography had fully transitioned into digital workflows, and it was intended to function seamlessly across modern software, web, and print environments. Historically, Acumin reflects the influence of earlier systematic type families—especially Adrian Frutiger’s Univers—through its extensive range of coordinated weights and widths, totaling dozens of styles. Slimbach designed Acumin to be a highly neutral and flexible type system that could perform in a wide variety of uses, from interface design to signage and editorial typography. Its release also reflects Adobe’s broader role in the digital type era, as Adobe Originals helped redefine how typefaces are produced, distributed, and used in fully digital design ecosystems.</p>

			    
			<h3>General Comparisons</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/kk.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase k in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The lowercase ‘k’ in Univers and Acumin are the same height from baseline to ascender line. The leg and arm on the Univers ‘k’ create a v-shape and touch the stem together whereas the leg of the Acumin ‘k’ connects to the arm. The arm of the Acumin ‘k’ is all that connects to the stem..</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="images/tt.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase t in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>t lowercase: The Univers terminal on the ‘t’ is longer and more curved compared to the Acumin ‘t’. The top of the stem of the Acumin ‘t’ is straight across whereas the Univers stem is slanted.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/yy.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase y in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The aperture of the Acumin ‘y’ is slightly smaller than the Univers ‘y’. The Acumin descender curves parallel to the descender line whereas the Univers descender ends straight.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/AA.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the upper case A in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>A uppercase: The capital ‘A’ of Univers is taller than that of Acumin ‘A’, but the crossbar of the Acumin is slightly higher and thicker. This is due to the tighter apex of the Acumin ‘A’.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/RR.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the upper case R in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The Univers and Acumin uppercase ‘R’ are very similar. The spur on the tail of the Univers ‘R’ is more curved than that of the Acumin ‘R’.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Artboard 3 copy 2.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the number 8 in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The upper and lower counters of the Univers ‘8’ are the same shape. The upper counter is smaller than the lower counter in the Acumin ‘8’.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Artboard 4 copy.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the comma in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>Both the Univers and Acumin comma touches the descender line. The Acumin comma curves around the previous character but the Univers comma remains straight.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Artboard 4 copy 2.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the quotation in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The Univers quotations are straight and end at the x-height whereas the Acumin quotations are curved, ending slightly past the x-height.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Edgy.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing four letters of Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The lowercase ‘d’, ‘g’, and ‘y’  all share the same x-height. The Univers ‘E’ ascender is slightly taller than Acumin. Univers letterforms appear slightly more rigid in their curves, whereas Acumin curves are smoother and more rounded.</figcaption>
			</figure>


			<h3>Some Similarities</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/a.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase a in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The bowl, terminal, and spur of the Univers and Acumin lowercase ‘a’ are extremely similar. </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="images/e.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase e in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The ‘e’ on Univers and Acumin share the same x-height. The finial on the Univers ‘e’ is taller and more square than the Acumin finial.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/g.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase g in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The ‘g’ of these two typefaces are single-storied. The Univers ‘g’ has a slightly bigger bowl and deeper ear than the Acumin ‘g’.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/r.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the lowercase r in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The stem of the ‘r’ for Univers and Acumin are the same height. The Univers shoulder curves more downward and is wider than the Acumin  shoulder.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/b.svg"

			</figure>			

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Artboard 4 copy 3.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the brace in Univers in Acumin">
				<figcaption>The Univers braces are thinner than the Acumin braces, thus creating a sharper point than Acumin. </figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/Artboard 4 copy 4.svg"
					 alt="A graphic comparing the brackets in Univers in Acumin">
